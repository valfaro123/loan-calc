# loan-calc
loan calculater web app built using js
based on the project in Brad Traversy's JS udemy course

To-do:
1: imporve positioning of gif or remove all together
2: don't show gif if fields are empty (check before calculating)
3: improve the remove of alert (too sudden for my liking. find way to make it fade out)
4: Style with CSS remove in line styling
